com,"$One of the strangest and most famous plays in baseball history!"
com,"With one out and the bases loaded Babe Herman hit a flyball off the"
com,"Ebbets Field right field screen. Hank DeBerry easily scored from third"
com,"base. Dazzy Vance, the runner at second base, held up to see if the ball"
com,"would be caught and then proceeded around third base and headed for home."
com,"Chick Fewster, the runner at first base, also held up before beginning"
com,"his journey around the bases. Babe Herman, not paying attention to what"
com,"was transpiring in front of him, charged around second base and headed"
com,"for third. Brooklyn's third base coach, seeing Herman close on the heels"
com,"of Fewster, both on their way to third base, yelled 'Go back, go back' in"
com,"attempt to get Babe to return to second base. However, for some strange"
com,"reason, Vance thought those words were meant for him, so he returned"
com,"to third base! Fewster saw Vance returning to third base so he"
com,"slowed his approach. Herman, though, never slowed and slid 'safely'"
com,"into third. Confusion reigned at Ebbets Field since nobody had ever"
com,"seen three baserunners on the same base before! Boston infielders"
com,"tagged all three Dodgers during the ensuing confusion. After huddling,"
com,"the umpires ruled that Herman was out for passing Fewster (Babe had"
com,"slid into third base moments before Fewster had arrived), and Fewster"
com,"was out when he was tagged since Vance was the rightful occupant of"
com,"third base. So receiving vital assists from bad baserunning in front"
com,"of him and a woefully ineffective third base coach, Babe Herman had just"
com,"doubled into a double-play."
